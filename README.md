# Solar-System-Visualization
3D Visualization of planetary orbits in  the solar system using Python, Matplotlib, and mpl_toolkits

# Solar System Visualization 🌌

This project visualizes the orbits of the eight planets in our solar system using Python and Matplotlib's 3D plotting tools.  
It provides a basic, scaled model of planetary motion in a top-down orbital view using real astronomical data.

---

## 🔭 Objective

To build a Python-based 3D visualization of the solar system's planets orbiting the Sun, using:
- Semi-major axes (in astronomical units) for orbital radii
- Circular orbit approximation
- 3D plotting to enhance understanding of planetary distances and layout

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Orbital Mechanics (Simplified)
- Planetary Motion and Semi-Major Axes
- 3D Coordinate Geometry
- Data Visualization in Aerospace/Astronomy

---

## 📊 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d`

---

## 🚀 Features

- Models all 8 planets from Mercury to Neptune
- Uses real astronomical units for semi-major axes
- Clean 3D visualization with dark theme
- Sun is centered, planetary orbits shown in XY-plane
